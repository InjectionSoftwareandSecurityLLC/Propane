## Documentation:
[Propane Documentation](https://github.com/InjectionSoftwareDevelopment/Propane/blob/master/doc/markdown/)



## How to use Propane:
[Propane Setup Guide](https://github.com/InjectionSoftwareDevelopment/Propane/blob/master/doc/markdown/propane_setup.md)

## Current Features:
1. Propane accessories! Plugins!
2. Allowlists and blocklists
3. Timed events
4. Templates
5. Improved server status checks and scoreboard server status
6. Target IP scoreboard toggle
7. Scoreboard backups

## TODO:
1. Improve logging functionality to help be more "service" friendly
2. Add optional systemd service configuration to make service management easier (no more need for screen or tmux!)
3. Contribute a bare bones officially supported vagrant and docker image to make setup a breeze
4. ?Potential frontend and templating rewrite maybe?
